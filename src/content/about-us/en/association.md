The Equality Factory is an association established in 2009 in Łódź based on the local group of the Campaign Against Homophobia. We are the largest cultural and educational organization in the region, working for LGBTQ+ people and one of the most dynamically operating equality organizations in Poland. We deal with broadly understood culture animation, promoting accepting attitudes towards non-​heterosexual and transgender people, as well as equality and anti-​discrimination education.

Since 2010, we have been organizing the Equality March and Marathon, debates on social issues, cultural meetings, film screenings, dance parties, street pickets, community kitchens and academic lectures. We co-​organize the Human Library in Łódź.

We run support groups for LGBTQ+ people, transgender people and their parents, and we provide free psychological counselling.

For us, equality is essential. We want LGBTQ+ people to feel safe and to live with dignity in Poland. We invite entrepreneurs, educational units, non-​governmental organizations and private persons to cooperate with us. Łódź flows for equality!

Do you want to act with us? We are always looking for new people to join our association! Just write to us on Facebook and make an appointment!
