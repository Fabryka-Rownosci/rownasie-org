Are you an LGBTQ+ person? Do you encounter difficulties due to this fact or do you want to talk about your experiences in an atmosphere of understanding and acceptance? Are you planning to come out, but you don't know how to prepare for it? Are you looking for people full of empathy and warmth? If you answered yes to at least one of these questions - the support group run by the Equality Factory is for you.

We create a safe place where each person can confidently share their difficulties and problems with acceptance related to being themselves, experience in difficult situations, thoughts and feelings, and other issues.

Meetings are held under the supervision of an experienced psychotherapist. You can join the group during the recruitment period. If you want to join - contact us at pomoc@rownasie.org
