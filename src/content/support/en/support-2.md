Are you a transgender person looking for support? Do you need understanding or want to exchange experiences with other transgender people? Or maybe you are wondering what to do to feel better,  where to look for support? 

If so, we invite you to the meetings of the support group for transgender people! Here you will have the opportunity to share your experiences and hear how others have dealt with these or similar issues. And if you don't want to say anything - you don't have to, you can just listen. The group aims to create a comfortable atmosphere that will allow people to take a break from their problems and show them that they are not alone. 

Meetings are held under the supervision of an experienced psychotherapist. You can join the group during the recruitment period. If you want to join - contact us at pomoc@rownasie.org
