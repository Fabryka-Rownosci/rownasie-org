The project Gender Upon a Time II aims to contribute to the development of societies that are inclusive towards every kind of diversity, especially themes related to gender roles and expression. Traditional gender roles, which are culturally and historically defined, can threaten the free expression of one’s own gender identity and provoke at the same time exclusion and discrimination. The main objective of the project is to provide a process of exchange and confrontation among different cultures, in order to raise awareness on the socially constructed nature of traditional gender roles; this will be achieved through theatrical and non-formal education methodologies.

## Objectives:
* To create a safe space of exchange anddiscussion to raise awareness and knowledgeabout other cultures and countries, developing active participation;
* To deepen concepts related to gender roles and expression
* To recognize and deconstruct stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination about gender and sexual identity;
* To use theatrical tools and methodologies enforcing one’s empathetic attitude;
* To share similarities and differences of social construction processes of traditional gender roles;
* To spread knowledge of the Erasmus+ program.
