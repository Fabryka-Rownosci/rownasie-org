Are you a parent or guardian of an LGBTQ+ person looking for help? We invite you to the meetings of the support group, led by other parents of LGBTQ+ people, run by the Equality Factory Association and the local group of the "We, parents" Association.

Meetings are held in a discreet atmosphere, and the people leading the group make sure that the people visiting them receive answers to all their questions and help in understanding their children.
